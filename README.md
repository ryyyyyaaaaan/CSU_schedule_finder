# CSU_schedule_finder
A tool to help find the best class schedule at CSU

Dependencies: 
Chrome 59 or newer, 
Selenium

I am a student at Colorado State University and this is a script I wrote in python to help me find the perfect schedule every semester. The python script uses selenium webdriver and headless chrome to scrape the class data off of the course registration website and then from there it finds every possible schedule, and prints that to the command line.
